## ðŸ”‹ Batteries Included

This template comes pre-configured with all the boilerplate for compiling Rust
to WebAssembly and hooking into a Webpack build pipeline.

- `npm run start` -- Serve the project locally for development at
  `http://localhost:8080`.

- `npm run build` -- Bundle the project (in production mode).

## ðŸš´ Using This Template

This template shows how it's possible to use wasm-bindegen to generate a single
wasm file for both the the frontend and for workers - simplifying build tremendously.
